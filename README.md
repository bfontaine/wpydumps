# WPyDumps

**WPyDumps** is a Python module to work with [dumps of Wikipedia][dumps].

It allows one to parse and extract relevant information from dump files without
un-compressing them on-disk.

It works with (at least) these dumps:
- `pages-meta-history….xml-….7z` (“All pages with complete edit history”)
- `pages-meta-current.xml.bz2`

This is quite experimental for now.

## Install

    pip install wpydumps

## Usage
The parser uses [SAX][] to read the files as a stream. It takes a reader or a
filename and a page callback function. It parses the file and call that
function with each page.

Pages are represented as `wpydumps.model.Page` objects. They include the pages’
details as well as their revisions (`wpydumps.model.Revision`). Each revision
holds a reference to its contributor (`wpydumps.model.Contributor`).

```python3
import wpydumps.parser as p

def simple_page_callback(page):
    print(page.title)

# parse from a local archive
p.parse_pages_from_archive_filename("myfile.7z", simple_page_callback)

# parse from an uncompressed file
with open("myfile") as f:
    p.parse_pages_from_reader(f, simple_page_callback)
```

The text of each revision is dropped by default. You can disable this behavior
by passing `keep_revisions_text=True` to the parser function. Revisions always
have a `text_length` and `diff_length` `int` attributes.

### Examples
```python3
from wpydumps.parser import parse_pages_from_archive_filename

def page_callback(page):
    pass # do something with the page

# use the appropriate filename
parse_pages_from_archive_filename(
    "frwiki-20190901-pages-meta-history1.xml-p3p1630.7z",
    page_callback)
```
#### Print all pages and their number of revisions
```python3
def page_callback(page):
    print(page.title, len(page.revisions))
```
#### Print all pages and their number of contributors
```python3
def page_callback(page):
    contributors = set()
    for rev in page.revisions:
        contributors.add(rev.contributor.username or rev.contributor.ip)

    print("%s: %d contributors" % (page.title, len(contributors)))
```
